# Introduction

The central theme of this book is that 

 * segfaults caused by attempts to dereference null pointers, or access to uninitialized memory
 C++11 provided mechanisms to reduce this class of error
 
  * Impossible states
  requires discipline(?) to fix ... requires sounds software design principles, built around strong types
  st.
  impossible states are not representable

## Operational vs. denotational reasoning

Avoidance of copies, memory re-allocation etc.

## C++ jargon

The C++ language has developed in isolation to mainstream programming languages, acquiring a cult of ad-hoc names unused outside of C++.
These will be marked in this text as :alien: and translated into conventional language.

## Deprecated C++ features

Old-school C++ features are included for completeness, because you are quite likely to come across these in real-world codebases. Marked with :skull:
