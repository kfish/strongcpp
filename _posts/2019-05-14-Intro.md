title: Practical Lessons from Functional Programming
---

Functional programming loosely refers to various approaches that emphasize
declarative software design, originally emphasizing the composition of
functions and more recently applying declarative techniques to general data
structures, protocols and testing methods.

These techniques have been demonstrated to produce provably correct software
using various programming languages, but we still use C++ because it
prioritizes efficiency, direct access to hardware and zero-overhead abstractions.

Can we get the same benefits in C++ without sacrificing performance?

This series explores the design principles that make functional programming
less error-prone, like making impossible states unrepresentable
and choosing types so that the build fails if we forget a corner case.

We demonstrate these principles in C++ using standard types including
std::optional, std::expected, std;:variant and ranges, and of course make
use of lambdas, std::function, type traits and concepts. We'll put these
together to build tiny classes that compose to make robust objects that
can be exhaustively tested, and programs that can be put into production
with confidence.
