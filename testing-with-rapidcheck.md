Purpose: separate testing of reasons for doing stuff vs. how to do stuff
(declarative by design)

ie. YES have tests for "can I do this operation"
but separate that from tests for WHY are we or are we not doing these operations


comparison:

vs. MOCKS (die in a fire)

vs. unit/"functional" tests: still have these for HOW

vs. end-to-end testing (yup)
